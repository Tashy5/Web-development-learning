Here I was trying to practice using forms, but I was having trouble getting the labels to work properly.
I will need to do more research on this. I was confused about why the label type for email had to be
the same for the id and what the point of having an id was.

<!--The next section will be able the different type of buttons and when to use them-->
<body>
<button>Start Game</button>
<!--I was able to get the button to work, but I am not sure how to make it do something when clicked.-->
<button type="button">Show Alert</button>
<!--This kind of button with the type attribute controls the behaviour of the button-->
<form action="">
    <label for="email">Email address:</label>
    <input required type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter Email Address here"/>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    <button type="reset">Reset</button>
</body>
</html>
<!--One thing I needed to wrap my head around was the difference between the id and name attribute 
when creating forms. The id attribute is used to link the input to the label. Whereas the name 
attribute specifies the key for form data when submitting to a server. For perspective, using both
the id and name attributes for one form labelled "email" will 1. link the input to the label and
2. make sure that the data that gets sent to the server will be "email:example@email.com", giving it
a title which makes it more readable.-->
