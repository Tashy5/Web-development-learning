<!--For this payment screen, I learnt about the <span> and aria-hidden elements and attributes.
    The <span> element is used to add text into the label element, it has no semantic meaning. But
    it does make CSS styling easier by allowing whatever is inside <span> to be styled differently.
    The aria-hidden attribute is accessability rich internet applications. It means that people with
    screen readers won't hear whatever is inside <span>. The screen reader would have already told
    the user that the input is required from the required attribute. So using the <aria-hidden> avoids
    confusion.-->
