                Hi there! I'm Thomas Ashton, a training programmer who is trying to make a website for the wonderful and mysterious Mr. Whiskers!<br>
                Mr. Whiskers is a loving and playful cat, who often gets misjudged by his grumpy appearance. His favourite food are the cat treats called "Dreamies"

<!--One note for improvement here would be to use the article element. Article elements are typically used for blog posts or with a chunk of text which can make sense on
it's own. This is to give semantic meaning to the HTML document-->

    <!--Another improvement would be creating a section element for the overall contact infomation section, and then using the address element just for the
    phone number and email address. This is because the <h2> heading is not part of the address and therefore should not be part of the address element. However,
    in my code, it is. Which is wrong.-->
