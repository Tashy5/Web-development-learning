<!--
Key things learnt:
1. using display:flex;
justify-content:center;
alight items:center;
height:100vh;
I haven't fully learnt what all these selectors fully do, but they managed to make my blog post card align center vertically.
Used overflow:hidden; to wrap the image to the border radius selector so that the image had curved edges too.
Used display:inline-block; to make my .read more act more like a button shaped link. I need more practice with
display:inline-block; because I am not fully confident.
Paired .read-more and :hover.
